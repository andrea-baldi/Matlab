# Mie_Scattering_and_Absorption_Sphere
Matlab scripts from the Baldi Lab

This script reads the relative permittivity data of a material and uses Mie theory to compute the scattering, absorption, and extinction cross-sections for a spherical particle of that material embedded in a lossless medium.
The permittivity file has to be a tab-delimited text file with three columns: energy (in eV), epsilon1, epsilon2
